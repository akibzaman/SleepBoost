## Abstract
Clinicians' workload in sleep studies has lightened due to advances in Automatic Sleep Stage Classification (ASSC). While deep learning (DL) models, with their intricate architectures like attention mechanisms and transfer learning, have made significant strides, their "black-box" nature raises trust concerns among medical practitioners. Addressing this, we introduce SleepBoost, a transparent Multi-level Tree-based Ensemble Model tailored for ASSC. Utilizing our crafted Feature Engineering Block (FEB), we extracted 42 time and frequency domain features, of which 17 were selected via a mutual information score threshold (>0.23). SleepBoost's architecture integrates three fundamental linear models into a multi-level tree structure, enhanced with a reward-based adaptive weight allocation. On the Sleep-EDF-20 dataset, SleepBoost achieved an accuracy of 86.3%, an f1-score of 80.9%, and a Cohen kappa score of 0.807, surpassing leading DL models in ASSC. An ablation study further emphasizes the pivotal role of feature selection.

## Overview of the Method

<br> ![SleepBoost](/figures/SleepBoost.jpg)
<br> *General architecture of SleepBoost. We trained Random FOrest (RF), Light Gradient Boosting (LGBoost), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as a unit block model for SleepBoost using the training dataset. Adaptive weight calculation is initiated using the prediction of the unit block models. Finally, a weighted score is calculated to predict the sleep stage*

## Prepare dataset ##
We evaluated our SleepBoost with [Sleep-EDF](https://www.physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/) dataset.

For the [Sleep-EDF]([https://physionet.org/pn4/sleep-edfx/](https://www.physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/)) dataset, you can run the following scripts to download SC subjects.

    cd data
    chmod +x download_physionet.sh
    ./download_physionet.sh

Then run the following script to extract specified EEG channels and their corresponding sleep stages.

    python prepare_physionet.py --data_dir data --output_dir data/eeg_fpz_cz --select_ch 'EEG Fpz-Cz'
    python prepare_physionet.py --data_dir data --output_dir data/eeg_pz_oz --select_ch 'EEG Pz-Oz'

## Create a virtual environment with venv/conda

```bash
python3 -m venv sleepboost
source .sleepboost/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
